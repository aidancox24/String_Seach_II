# Project Search Algorithms

We were tasked to research, provide details and code an implementation the following search algorithms. 

## Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm

TBD

## Boyer-Moore-Algorithm
TBD

Usage

Our search application can be run by using 3 different types of applications - a command-line application (CLI), a Windows application, and a web-based GUI. This section provides information on how to use those applications.

## Search CLI

We have a search executable that allows you to directly use our search algorithms via a command line. Simply download the search CLI executable [here](http://github.com/fooo) and see the following usage instructions below.

TBD - have a link to a video which shows it running.
TBD Show commands and screenshots 

## Search Windows Application

We have created a nice, simple windows application that presents you with a GUI to collect the search information and run the search algorithms. Showing you the search results in the GUI. Simply download the windows search application [here](http://github.com/fooo) and see the following usage instructions below.

TBD - have a link to a video which shows it running.
TBD Show commands and screenshots

## Search Web Application

We thought it would be cool to create a web-based search application that would be able to run our search algorithms in a web browser (i.e. Chrome, Edge, etc). Running this web-based application involves a little more setup since it requires you to start our simple web server which has the logic of handling browser requests and performing the search. You see instructions on how to set up this environment here.  The information below shows some details and screenshots on our search web application.

TBD - have a link to a video which shows it running.
TBD - show our slide which shows overview.
TBD - show some


# Demos

This section provides some demos of the 3 search applications we have created.

# Sample Bullets
Here is some sample bullets if we need it.

- Bullet 1: [Link](http://foo)
- Bullet 2: [Link](http://foo)
- Bullet 3: [Link](http://foo)

# Sample Code

Example if we need to show some code...

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
Hello World!
```



# Sample Commands

To run our [search CLI](http://foo) do the following:

```
$ searchIt KMP aaba abababababa
```

You will see output similar to the following:
